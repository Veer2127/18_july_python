#1) What is File function in python? What is keywords to create and write file.
    
'''
readlines() : This function returns a list where each element is single line of that file. 
write() : This function writes a fixed sequence of characters to a file. 
writelines() : This function writes a list of string. 
append() : This function append string to the file instead of overwriting the file.
'''

#13) Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python? 
'''An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. 
    In general, when a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. 
    An exception is a Python object that represents an error.'''

#14) How many except statements can a try-except block have? Name Some built-in exception classes: 
'''A try-except block in Python can have multiple except statements, allowing you to handle different types of exceptions in different ways. 
    You can specify one or more except blocks to catch and handle specific exceptions.'''

#15) When will the else part of try-except-else be executed?
'''when no exception occurs
When will the else part of try-except-else be executed? Explanation: The else part is executed when no exception occurs'''

#16) Can one block of except statements handle multiple exception?
'''Yes, a single block of except statements in Python can handle multiple exceptions. 
    This feature allows you to handle different types of exceptions using a single block of code''' 


#17) When is the finally block executed?

'''The finally block always executes when the try block exits. This ensures that the finally block is executed even if an unexpected exception occurs.
'''

#18) What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed?
'''It simply evaluates to False and does not raise any exception.
'''

#19) How Do You Handle Exceptions With Try/Except/Finally In Python? Explain with coding snippets.
'''First try clause is executed i.e. the code between try and except clause. 
    If there is no exception, then only try clause will run, except clause will not get executed. 
    If any exception occurs, the try clause will be skipped and except clause will run.'''

  

#20) Write python program that user to enter only odd numbers, else will raise an exception.
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
mod = num % 2
if mod > 0:
    print("This is an odd number.")
else:
    print("This is an even number.")


#21) What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java.?

'''Java doesn't support Multiple Inheritance, but we can use interfaces (instead of classes) to achieve the same purpose.'''

#22) How to Define a Class in Python? What Is Self? Give An Example Of A Python Class 

'''The self variable in Python can also be used to access a variable field within the class definition. 
    Let us understand this with the help of example code: class Student: def __init__(self, Alex): self.name = Alex #name created in constructor def get_student_name(self): return self.name'''


#23) Write a Python class named Rectangle constructed by a length and width and a method which will compute the area of a rectangle
class Rectangle():
    def __init__(self, l, w):
        self.length = l
        self.width  = w

    def rectangle_area(self):
        return self.length*self.width

newRectangle = Rectangle(12, 10)
print(newRectangle.rectangle_area())

#24) Write a Python class named Circle constructed by a radius and two methods which will compute the area and the perimeter of a circle
class Circle():
    def __init__(self, r):
        self.radius = r

    def area(self):
        return self.radius**2*3.14
    
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2*self.radius*3.14

NewCircle = Circle(8)
print(NewCircle.area())
print(NewCircle.perimeter())

#25) Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? What is init? Or What Is A Constructor In Python?

'''A triangle is a polygon with 3 sides. So, we can create a class called Triangle which inherits from Polygon . This makes all the attributes of Polygon class available to the Triangle class. We don't need to define them again'''

'''
Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object. The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created. In Python the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created.'''

'''
A Constructor is a special kind of method that have same name as the class in python self variable do the same. It can be used to set the values of the members of an object'''

#26) What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology? 


'''
Instantiation − The creation of an instance of a class. Method − A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition. Object − A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods
'''

#27) What is used to check whether an object o is an instance of class A?

'''Conclusion. The `isinstance()` function can be used to check if an object is an instance of a particular class'''
